# Youth Justice Nav

A project with UCLA law school to help defendants in the Juvenile Justice system in Los Angeles County. The aim of the project is to educate youth on how to navigate the justice system in LA County. 

## Project context

TBD -- Civic projects often exist within a larger context that may include multiple stakeholders, historic relationships, associated research, or other details that are relevant but not *required* for direct contributions. Gathering these details in one place is useful, but the ReadMe isn't that place. Use this section to [link to a Google Doc](#) or other documentation repository where contributors can dig in if they so choose. This is also a good place to link to your Code of Conduct.

## Technology used

- Slack for instant message communication
- Github & Google Docs for documentation
- Zoom/Google Meet for weekly meetings
