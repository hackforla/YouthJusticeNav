# Project title and description

A project with UCLA law school to help defendants in the Juvenile Justice system in Los Angeles County. The aim of the project is to educate youth on how to navigate the justice system in LA County. 

### Project context

TBD -- Civic projects often exist within a larger context that may include multiple stakeholders, historic relationships, associated research, or other details that are relevant but not *required* for direct contributions. Gathering these details in one place is useful, but the ReadMe isn't that place. Use this section to [link to a Google Doc](#) or other documentation repository where contributors can dig in if they so choose. This is also a good place to link to your Code of Conduct.

### Technology used

- Slack for instant message communication
- Github & Google Docs for documentation
- Zoom/Google Meet for weekly meetings 

## How to contribute

- Join the team on Slack channel and at our weekly Wednesday night meeting at 6PM
- To help with user research, contact TBD

- To contribute to the code, contact TBD

# Onboarding Process

1. Add your info to the [team roster](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14NiIUGaRhz34E_cTtWU-B9kFGaHt-1nSlghzhtDqbbE/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=105806038518241181042)
2. Create a Slack Account & Add yourself to Slack channel #youth-justice-nav on hackforla.slack.com



## Installation instructions

1. Step-by-step instructions help new contributors get a development environment up and running quickly.
2. You'll want to find the balance between being specific enough for novices to follow, without being so specific that you reinvent the wheel by providing overly-basic instructions that can be found elsewhere.
3. Feel free to adapt this section and its sub-sections to your own processes.
4. Alternatively, you can move everything from *Installation instructions* through *Testing* to a separate **Contributing.md** file to keep your **ReadMe.md** more succinct.


### Working with issues
